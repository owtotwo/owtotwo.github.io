> This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the 
computer.

> "I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep 
fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the 
paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to 
take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were 
responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't 
think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in 
new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer 
science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become 
missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of 
those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel 
as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands,
I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than 
when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more."

## 前言

`created on 2017-01-17`

有别于上一篇的博文（["The C Programming Language - Second Edition" Book Review][1]），本
文并非是对 _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ 一书的详细反馈及补充，而是
学习此书的过程记录。这是因为阅读前者是在已有C语言丰富的知识基础的情况下阅读的，所以只是将脑海里零碎的
知识点一一按照书中的目录结构列出，并根据网络资源及相关标准文案精准化。而阅读后者是在仅有部分计算机科学
领域的基础知识的前提下进行的，主要目的是为了初步学习函数式编程的相关思想以及抽象化程序设计的理念，同时
亲身感受一下这本被大多数编程者奉为神作的书的魅力。

虽然在一年内基本是不可能填完这个坑的，也许第一章也不能完成，但是坑还是要挖的。
