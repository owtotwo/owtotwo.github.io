# The first day in 2016 #

For the reason of the final exams coming, I think I should stop my self-learn and pay my attention to the subjects with the final exams.

So, from July in last year to now, I have acquired lots of knowledge about the software engineering, such as: (in time order)
- C programming language
- basic algorithm
- C++
- python
- javascript
- Html
- nodejs(a little bit)
- date structure
- a bit basic use of linux(ubuntu)
- compiler construction(mainly in regex)
- Assembly
- design patterns(abandon)
- Operating System(learning now).

And there are some related reference books as below:
- *C primer plus (5th)*
- *C++ primer plus (6th)*
- *Algorithm (4th)*
- *Play with Date Structure*
- *Pointers on C*
- *Coding interviews : Questions, Analysis and Solution*
- *The beginning of Algorithm Competition* (author: srbga, Liu Rujia)
- *Compilers : Principles, Techniques and Tools* (not recommanded for self-learning)
- *Effective C++*
- *xv6-chinese-manual*
- *Computer System : A programmer's perspective*
- *Computer's Mind Philosophical Principles of Operating System*

Although the majority of items above are learning weak (only the C programming language is well relatively...), I will try my best to complete them after the final exam(in winter vacation).

OK, that is all.

Bless to myself for my final exam...
